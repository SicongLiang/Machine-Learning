1.1 Welcome
Machine Learning
  - Grew out of work in AI
  - New capability for computers
  
  Examples:
    - Database mining
        Large datasets from growth of automation/web.
        E.g., Web click data, medical records, biology, engineering
    - Applications can't program by hand.
        E.g., Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, most of Natural Language Processing(NLP), Computer Vison.
    - Self-customizing programs(用户自定制化程序) software learn by itself
        E.g., Amazon, Netflix product recommendations
    - Understanding human learning(brain, real AI).

1.2 What is Machine Learning?
Definition: (1)Field of study that gives computers that ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel 1959)
(2)"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance
on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
E.g., T: Classifying emails as spam(垃圾邮件) or not spam.  E: Watching you label emails as spam or not spam.  P: The number(or fraction)
of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam.

Machine learning algorithms: （most used）
  - Supervised learning(监督学习)
  - Unsupervised learning(无监督学习)
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
  - Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems. (Also ML algorithms)
Also talk about: Practical advice for applying learning algorithms. (takes a lot of time too!)

1.3 Supervised Learning(监督学习)
E.g., Housing price prediction: 用一次函数还是二次函数来拟合
Supervised Learning: "right answers" given
That is, we gave it a data set of houses in which for every example in this data set, we told it what is the right price so what is the
actual price that, that house sold for and the toss of the algorithm was to just produce more of these right answers such as for this 
new house, you know, that your friend may be trying to sell.
Define with a bit more terminology: Regression(回归问题): Predict continuous valued output(price)

E.g., Breast cancer(malignant, benign)
